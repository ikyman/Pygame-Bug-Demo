This game is mostly to demonstrate issue https://github.com/ikyman/A-Gio-Exposition-for-Pygame-Tkinter-Folk/issues/2

The plan is to create a game which uses the far right section of the keyboard, where all the punctuation marks are.
If I am correct, switching to a sufficiently different keyboard would render said demonstration game entirely unplayable.

What game should I choose? Thanks to being bored in middle school, I have a plethora of games written in Python. 
I need a game that is sufficiently different from all my other games and has a use for each of the 10 or so keys on the right-hand side. (And won't take ages to implement)

I lay there, flipping through the possible game genres, when it hit me!

# A Fighting game!

"Yes, yes", I said, stroking my chin. "That idea is a win".

# A warning from Misako and Kyoko

I got the Game "River City Girls" free from Epic (The games store, not the EHR company). Now that I have it, I might as well download it.

I've been liking it. But do you know what would make the game better? 
From my initial observation, All-But-Required Items for complete and total enjoyment of the game "River City Girls" include: A Big Screen, Two Game Controllers, and a Fiance (Or, barring that, a couple of mates and some beer).

I perceived the above missing items as missing because I was missing them.

What is to be done? Should I uninstall the game, flagging it to be re-downloaded when I am well and truely ready? Decision, Decision!

Note one of the required items is "Game controllers". You can play on the keyboard, but the controls are unintuative. 

More relevent to our situation, My keyboard took quite a beating. 
Now that I am engineering a game within the same genre with the design requirement that a keyboard be used, I'm forced to do things a bit differently.

# I spent half a second pondering a solution, and here's what I got

If not brawn? Why not brain? A Cerebral, High IQ, thinking man's erudite fighting game! A Choreographic (but relatively slow-paced) dance among my right-hand keys.

The only issue is 1: A Cerebral, High IQ, thinking man's erudite fighting game requires more thinking, IQ, and erudite cerebral power on my end, slowing down implementation times.

And 2: Trailblazing? this is a glorified bug report!
